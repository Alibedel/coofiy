# Recipe Book

## Background 
This application was inspired by my mom's cooking and the will to record and display it in the future. This CRUD application was developed using RESTful architecture principles and MERN stack technologies (MongoDB, ExpressJS. React v6.0, & Node.js)

## Application Details 
Upon starting the application, they will be in the login page of the site a user can login in if they have an account or click the `Sign up` navigation button to create an account.Once a user has logged in with, they will be brought to an index view of all the recipes in the foods list.


If you want to create a new recipe then you can click the `Create` button on the navigation bar. Once clicked you will be in a new page where you will be adding the name of the recipe, cusinie type, ingriedients, and cook time. After that you click on `Submit` button. You will then be redirected to the index view where your new recipe is saved at.

Once a user has recipe/s in the table they can check the details about that recipe by clicking on the food name. Also in the recipe details page you can see the details . Also there is an `Update` button once clicked will be redirected to the update form where information of that recipe is preloaded into the input text boxes which a user can now change. Once the changes have been made the user then hits the `Update` button once again and be redirected back to the detials page for that recipe with the new updated infromation. If a user does not need to have that recipe in they can simply hit the `Delete` button on the details page and then be redirected to the index page with an updated table without that recipe. A user can simply hit the `Logout` button and be redirected to the login page.

- recipe with video of someone making it.

- the cost of all ingredients at every food store.

- and star reviews on the recipes once used and recomandation on how to make it better.

- images of the final product of the recipes.
